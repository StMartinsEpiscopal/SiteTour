<h3>Welcome to St. Martin's Episcopal School!</h3>
<p>The St. Martin&rsquo;s experience is a journey that goes far beyond academics. Founded in 1947 as a coeducational, independent school, the school&rsquo;s mission is to prepare students to thrive in college and life through faith, scholarship, and service. </p> <p>The school&rsquo;s primary challenge is preparing its students for an uncertain, fast-changing, global environment in the 21st century. Leaders in business and education sectors worldwide affirm that schools now must create learning environments which focus not on the transmission of content, but on teaching children how to think, innovate, and create. </p> <p>St. Martin&rsquo;s program includes George Cottage, its early childhood program; a Lower School, prekindergarten through grade four; a Middle School, grades five through eight; and an Upper School in which students may qualify for 29 Honors/AP courses. An extraordinary three-part framework provides a cohesive structure for all the school&rsquo;s divisions: Its groundbreaking Innovation + Design program, consistent faith-based instruction and practice, and cutting-edge technology usage. Professional arts educators give students numerous opportunities to explore their creativity through the visual and performing arts. St. Martin&rsquo;s sponsors more than 20 LHSAA-sanctioned competitive sports teams. </p> <p>St. Martin&rsquo;s provides education for life. Contact us to learn more!</p> </div>
